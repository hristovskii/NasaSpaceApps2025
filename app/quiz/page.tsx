      "50 kilometers",
      "100 kilometers",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "The Chicxulub impactor was approximately 10 kilometers in diameter. This massive asteroid struck Earth about 66 million years ago, causing the extinction of the dinosaurs.",
  },

    question:
      "Which method is considered most effective for deflecting an asteroid years before impact?",
    options: [
      "Nuclear explosion on the surface",
      "Kinetic impactor (ramming it)",
      "Painting it white",
      "Laser ablation",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "A kinetic impactor, which involves ramming a spacecraft into the asteroid, is currently the most practical method. NASA's DART mission successfully demonstrated this technique in 2022.",
  },

    question:
      "How much energy would a 1 km asteroid traveling at 20 km/s release upon impact?",
    options: [
      "Equivalent to 1 megaton of TNT",
      "Equivalent to 100 megatons of TNT",
      "Equivalent to 10,000 megatons of TNT",
      "Equivalent to 1 million megatons of TNT",
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation:
      "A 1 km asteroid at 20 km/s would release approximately 1 million megatons of TNT equivalent energyâ€”enough to cause global climate effects and mass extinctions.",

    question:
      "What is the name of NASA's planetary defense coordination office?",
    options: [
      "Near-Earth Object Program",
      "Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO)",
      "Asteroid Watch Division",
      "Space Guard Center",

    explanation:
      "NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) is responsible for detecting, tracking, and characterizing potentially hazardous asteroids and comets.",

    question:
      "An asteroid impact in the ocean would primarily cause damage through:",
    options: [
      "Boiling all the water",
      "Creating massive tsunamis",
      "Releasing toxic gases",
      "Freezing the ocean",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Ocean impacts generate massive tsunamis that can devastate coastal regions thousands of kilometers away. The impact energy displaces enormous volumes of water.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What percentage of near-Earth asteroids larger than 1 km have been discovered?",
    options: ["About 50%", "About 75%", "About 95%", "100%"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "NASA estimates that over 95% of near-Earth asteroids larger than 1 kilometer have been found. None of these currently pose a threat to Earth in the foreseeable future.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What was the size of the asteroid that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia in 2013?",
    options: ["5 meters", "20 meters", "50 meters", "100 meters"],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "The Chelyabinsk meteor was about 20 meters in diameter. It exploded in the atmosphere with the energy of about 500 kilotons of TNT, injuring over 1,500 people from shattered glass.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How long would we ideally need to deflect a large asteroid heading toward Earth?",
    options: ["1 month", "1 year", "10 years", "100 years"],
    correct: 2,
    explanation:
      "Ideally, we would need at least 10 years of warning to successfully deflect a large asteroid. The earlier we detect it, the smaller the deflection needed and the higher the chance of success.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the main composition of most asteroids?",
    options: [
      "Ice and frozen gases",
      "Rock and metal",
      "Pure iron",
      "Organic compounds",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "Most asteroids are composed of rock and metal. There are three main types: C-type (carbonaceous), S-type (silicate), and M-type (metallic), with C-type being the most common.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is a 'gravity tractor' in the context of asteroid deflection?",
    options: [
      "A large magnet that pulls asteroids",
      "A spacecraft that uses its gravity to slowly pull an asteroid off course",
      "A ground-based laser system",
      "A nuclear-powered rocket",
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation:
      "A gravity tractor is a theoretical spacecraft that would fly alongside an asteroid for years, using its own gravitational pull to gradually alter the asteroid's trajectory without touching it.",
